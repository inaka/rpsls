== Rock Paper Scissors Lizzard Spock in Erlang (by Inaka Labs)

based on (this game)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock]

The World Championship will take place on Tuesday March 27th. 

The prize is a ticket for the upcoming Erlang Factory on the 29th and 30th, in San Francisco.

To play this game just create a module that implements the *rpsls_player* behaviour, submit a pull-request, and we'll add it to the competition.

* Sponsored by [Inaka](http://inakanetworks.com)
* You can see some sample implementations on src/players
* If only one person enters, that person will win the ticket.
* The winner has the option to take our Erlang Factory 2012 ticket. 
* If the winner cannot *personally* go, they must inform us so we can give it to someone else.
* Entries must compile to BEAM code but can be in any language that can do so - effenne, LFE, Elixir, etc.
* Thanks to SpawnFest, which granted us the ticket, but we don't need it (we're already going) so we're having fun giving it away!                                                                            
* Our decision is final!
